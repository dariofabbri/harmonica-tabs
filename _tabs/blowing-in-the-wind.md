6   6 6  -6    6   -5 6   5 -4  4 
How many roads must a man wa-lk down 

5  6   6   -6   6   -5 6 
before you call him a man? 

5   -5  6   6 6  -6    
Yes 'n' how many seas  

6    -5 6    5  -4 4 
must a white do-ve sail 

5  6    6   -5     -5 5   -4 
be-fore she sleeps in the sand? 

5   -5  6   6 6  -6    
Yes 'n' how many times  

6    -5  6  6   -5    4 
must the cannon balls fly 

5  6    6    -6 6 -5    6 
be-fore they're forever banned? 

5   -5 -5    5  -4     
The an-swer, my friend,  

-4 5    5   5  -4  4 
is blow-in' in the wind, 

5   -5 -5  5  -4   -4  4  -3  4 
The answer is blow-in' in the wind.
