6    7    8  8   8-   7   8-  7   6- 7
From this valley they say you are going,

6  7    8    7     8     9   9-   8     8-
we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile,

9   9-   8   8   8-  7  8-  8   9  9-
for they say you are taking the sunshine,

6-   6-  6   7-     7   8-  8   8- 7
that has brightened our pathway awhile.


Come and sit by my side if you love me,
do not hasten to bid me adieu,
just remember the red river valley,
and the cowboy who loved you so true.

I've been thinking a long time my darling,
of the sweet words you never would say,
now alas must my fond hopes all vanish,
for they say you are going away.

Do you think of the valley you're leaving,
O how lonely and how dreary it will be,
and do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking,
and the pain you are causing to me.

They will bury me where you have wandered,
near the hills where the daffodils grow,
when you're gone from the red river valley,
for I can't live without you I know.
