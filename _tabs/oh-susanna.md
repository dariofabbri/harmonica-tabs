```
4 -4 5 6    6 -6 6 5
I came from Alabama

4    -4 5  5  -4 4  -4
With my banjo on my knee 

4 -4  5   6  6  -6 6 5
I'm goin' to Lou'siana

4  -4 5  5   -4  -4 4
My true love for to see.


4 -4  5   6   6     -6  6   5 4
It rained all night the day I left

-4  5  5    -4 4   -4
The weather it was dry 

4 -4 5  6  6   -6 6    5  4
The sun so hot I froze to death,

-4 5 5   -4    -4  4
Susanna, don't you cry.


-5  -5 -6 -6 -6  6     6   5   4   -4
Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me 

4 -4 5    6  6 -6 6 5
I've come from Alabama

4    -4 5 5   -4 -4 4
With my banjo on my knee.
